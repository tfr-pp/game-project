# SkyLink

Tiny game project made with monogame

The game isn’t finished yet. We’ve started working on a level-selection menu screen, but the menu system is really messy at the moment. We preferred to focus on the physics to make the game playable rather than on visual effects and menus.

## Requirements

- Monogame framework
- .NET 9.0 >
- An IDE preferably VS Code or JetBrains Rider

## Install

Go to jeu.DesktopGL and run:

- `dotnet restore`
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet run`

## TODO

    [X] Car physics
    [X] Track system and optimizing
    [X] Enemy movement and collision
    [X] XML saving levels
    [X] XML saving player profile
    [X] Importing textures
    [X] Menu system and level selection
    [ ] Better level select menu
    [ ] More levels
    [ ] XML to HTML via XSLT export
